Overview: Once a proud island nation southwest of the coast of the Blessed lands, civil war has engulfed it, 
with many proud and ancient houses rising up against the ruling monarchy, the Corwellians of Kroliator. Of 
the original 20 or so families that made up the aristocracy, only 9 now remain, each with their own newly-raised-up 
chivalric households. Now there are 8 Kingdoms: The Kroliatorian Empire, The Lordship of Dothiarn, The Tenoderan Duchy, 
The Stoylean Kingdom, The Gratolian Commonwealth, The Confederacy of Nostriolian and The Patellican Mercenaries.
