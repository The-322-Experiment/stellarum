The Kroliatorian Empire
Emperor: Varus Corwellian
Description: Once the rulers of Gratlundia, the Corwellians of Kroliator are now reduced to just a 
few loyalist towns and the great capital city of Krogatos. Situated in the center of the island, 
they are desperately attacked from all sides, kept alive by the gallant peasantry who benefited under 
their loose policies, which was their downfall, and now their savior. Varus has sworn an oath to reclaim 
his lands and execute the traitors, but that hope seems dim. Their relations with Drakeisle are decent, 
as they are both making a common offensive against the Dothiarnians, but most other states are at best 
hostilely neutral as of now. 

Army composition:
Troops: Heavily made up of halberd-wielding footmen, what they lack in heavy infantry, they make up 
with their fanatical fervor. These Krossi Guard, as they are now known, are a force to be reckoned with, 
and have proven that time and again.
Cavalry: Remnants of the knights that stayed loyal, now training new squires, are what remain of the 
cavalry force. However, their strength is still there, as these knights are what were once considered 
the finest in the realm.
Archers: Peasant hunters mainly make up this force, but these wily hunters are quite good shots, 
despite their horrible discipline and morale.
Horse Archers: None.
